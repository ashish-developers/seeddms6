# How Webauthn is implemented in SeedDMÐ…

## The registration process

## The login process

The login process is based on two methods in SeedDMS_Controller_Login. They
are both called from within a ajax call intitiated when the user clicks
the 'Authenticate with Webauthn' button on the login page.

preparelogin() is the first method which receives the login name enterned
into login form. The method returns a json object containing challenge.
That challange is passed on to the javascript function `webauthnAuthenticate()`
definined in `views/bootstrap/class.Login.php`. `webauthnAuthenticate()`
starts the dialog between the user and the browser, basically asking the
user to grant access by touching the usb key. `webauthnAuthenticate()` returns
an assertion which is passed to the second ajax call `login()`. It will
authenticate the user by checking if one of the keys previously stored
in the users' profile matches the assertion.
